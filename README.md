# arogi-demos
A spatial optimization showcase from your pals at Arogi.

The repo has simple implementations of the Max Cover Location Problem (MCLP) and the p-Median problem. With numerous (all open source) dependencies, the easiest way to get this up and running on your own machine is to use the included [Docker instructions](docker-instructions.md).
