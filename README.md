# arogi-demos
A web-accessible spatial optimization showcase from your pals at Arogi  


:crystal_ball: index.html - a web user interface for an example of the Maximal Covering Location Problem (to start). It requires: /images /leaflet arogi_dark.css, grayprint.yaml, /interface/GISOps.pyc, interface/mclp_interface.py, and some data inside the /data directory (such as /data/data_SB1000.js).
